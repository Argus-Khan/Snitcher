A lightweight cross-platform computer activity monitoring program written in Python which works both on Linux and Windows, thus far it works via key-logging and screen monitoring with OCR.(WIP) Its intended use is for monitoring students activities on school computers during lessons at educational institutes and for parental control. Upon detecting devious activity i.e visiting NSFW sites, the program will take certain actions ranging from merely warning the user to cease their act to freezing(Rendering it unusable) the computer(WIP) until unfrozen by a teacher or instructor or a parent using a phone app or email or Facebook messenger. The program can also inform the instructor/parent about the activity through email(WIP), Facebook message, and the phone app(WIP). If told to inform the instructor/parent, the program will send the computer's name, words detected, a screen-shot of the computer screen and even the photo of the user in-case a web-cam is available.(WIP)
